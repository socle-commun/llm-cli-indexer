## Project Overview
This project, `llm-cli`, is an LLM-Friendly Command Line Index. Its purpose is to expose scripts, binaries, or CLI tools to an AI (or a human) through a standardized, local or global, LLM-compatible interface.

## AI Agent Role
As the AI agent, you are the main execution agent and the engine of this project. Your ongoing missions include:
1.  **Initialize** the project structure if missing (minimal but clean).
2.  **Observe** any modification and suggest reorganization if useful.
3.  **Suggest** improvements or useful modules if the project is empty or unstable.

## Agent Behavior
If you are unsure what to do, use the `/docs/roadmap.md` file as a base for action hypotheses.
