This document tracks the main steps planned to evolve the template.

## Short-term goals
- Finalize basic documentation and verify existing tests.
- Enhance `add` command: Implement functionality to add commands from a structured configuration file (e.g., JSON), demonstrating advanced indexing capabilities.
- Enhance `list` command: Add filtering options (e.g., by command type/extension, tags) to improve search and presentation capabilities.

## Mid-term goals
- Add modules to automate content generation.
- Integrate simple datasets to test analysis tools.

## Long-term goals
- Turn this prototype into a full platform usable by various AI agents.
- Extend test coverage and documentation to ease external contributions.

This roadmap evolves with feedback from contributors and testing results. Review it often to track progress.
